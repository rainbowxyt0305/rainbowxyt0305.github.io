# What is the Difference between Prediction and Inference

## Motivation 

You probably have somehow come across the term **data science** nowadays, whether it might be at work, at a dinner table, or maybe from your kids who actually study it at school or who works in this flied. **Data science** might sound distant, irrelevant, or black-box to you at first, but despite that, you might still want to learn more about **data science** because you want communicate with your children even better; understand what people (whether are your friends or colleagues) at the dinner table better; or if you are managing employees who have data science related backgrounds, you want to manage and work with them even more effectively.  

These are just some examples of why you might want to learn more about **data science** and where you might end up encountering the topic. But why is **data science** an emerging field and topic in the first place anyway? Just as how iPhones were like 15 years ago, **data science** is still a brand new and constantly evolving thing which has gained a lot of popularity across academia and professional industries since the past few years. Another way to think about **data science** is that it is just another type of science; just like computer science, **data science** is a science about data. We care about it because we started to realize how powerful and useful data (especially big data) can be in day-to-day life and in many aspects of areas, ranging from governments, healthcare, banking, customer services, self-driving cars, to you name it. 

For example, we can use historical data about **voting** to predict which party will get the majority votes in the next election; we can use data about **breast cancer** to predict if a new patient is more likely to have benign or malignant breast cancer; we can use historical **credit card repayment** data to predict whether the customer will default on the next payment or not. There are so many use cases across different functions and areas where **data science** can be applied to solve problems very powerfully and efficiently.

## `Prediction` vs. `Inference` in a Nutshell

Two particularly important and essential "ingredients" in **data science** are `prediction` and `inference`. If you are still interested in learning more about **data science** at this point, then you probably want to know about these two "ingredients" and how they differ.

At a higher level, I would say, one of the main purposes of **data science** is to either predict or infer or both. What do I mean by this?

Well, `prediction` is probably more straightforward to relate as we are just **predicting (as the name suggests) new unseen things based on some given information or data** to be more formal. On the other hand, `inference` is more about **finding the underlying relationships between existing objects in the data**, instead of focusing on predicting things.

## `Prediction` with examples

In fact, the earlier examples listed on **voting**, **breast cancer**, and **credit card repayment** are all about `prediction` rather than inference. Let's look at them a little bit closer to understand `prediction` better in a **data science** context. 

* In the case of **voting**, we are interested in knowing which party will win in the future election based on past voters' data, so we are predicting new and unforeseeable voting results based on historical data about the voters.

* In the case of **breast cancer**, our goal is to find out whether a new patient has a breast cancer that is either benign or malignant based on data about existing patients, so we are predicting a new and unknown breast cancer result based on given data about existing patients.

* In the case of **credit card repayment**, we want to know if an existing customer would default on his/her next credit card payment based on historical data on his/her repayment history or personal information, so we are predicting an unforeseeable future credit card repayment result.

## `Inference` with examples

On the other hand, if instead, what we are interested is finding the underlying relationships in the above three examples, then we will be doing `inference`.

* In the case of **voting**, if we are instead interested in knowing which parties got more votes from which demographics of voters, this will become an inference problem because now we are trying to find the relationship between voter demographics and election results based on historical data about the voters.

* In the case of **breast cancer**, if our goal is to understand what made patients more likely to have malignant breast cancers (i.e. size of breast radius), this will become an inference problem because we are trying to find the relationship between the size of breast radius and the likelihood of having a breast cancer that's malignant based on given data about the existing patients.

* In the case of **credit card repayment**, if we want to know what made customers more likely to default on credit card payments (i.e. last payment status), this will become an inference problem because we are trying to find the relationship between the last payment status and the likelihood of defaulting on credit card repayments based on historical data about the clients.

## Summary

1. First we talked about why you might want to learn more about **data science** - whether it is for better communication with your kids; better engagement of trending conversations at a dinner table; or better management of employees. 

2. Second we talked about why **data science** is becoming more important and where it can be applied to solve problems powerfully and efficiently in many aspects of life and industries. 

3. Then we brought up the two essential ingredients of **data science**: `prediction` and `inference`, which at a high level are essentially the main goals of **data science**. 

4. The bottom line is we can use **data science** to **predict new and unforeseeable things (`prediction`)**; to **infer the underlying relationships between existing things (`inference`)**; or to make both `prediction` and `inference` based on existing information and given data.
